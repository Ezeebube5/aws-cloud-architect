# Recoverability in AWS

In this project I created highly available solutions to common use cases. I provisioned a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and used it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions. I also built a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.

This repo contains screenshots and logs of various checkpoints in the project as proof of completion.
